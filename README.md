# Xenimation

This repository allows you to create animation gifs showing how energy depositions occur in xenon, and how this can vary for different types of interactions.

There are four main notebooks you might want to use. The Xenimate_ERvsNR.ipynb notebook lets you vary just particle type (ER/NR) for a given energy and field. The Xenimate_VaryEnergy and Xenimate_VaryField.ipynb notebooks let you vary energy or field, while keeping others constant. The Xenimate_Custom.ipynb notebook lets you define a custom path through various energies, fields, and particle types.

See each notebook for more details.
